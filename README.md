Step-by-step:

    Prompt User for Inputs
    The script asks for four key inputs:

        Sender’s public key

        Recipient’s public key

        Gift amount to send

        Fee amount to pay for the transaction

    Calculate Total Needed
    It sums the gift amount and fee to determine the total assets required to fund the transaction.

    Export Notes CSV
    It runs the command to export the sender’s available notes into a CSV file named notes-<sender>.csv. This CSV contains your wallet’s individual notes with their amounts.

    Wait for CSV to Appear
    The script waits until the CSV file is created to continue.

    Parse and Select Notes
    It reads the CSV, skipping the header, and accumulates notes (identified by their “first” and “last” names and asset amounts) until the total asset amount covers the required total (gift + fee).

        If not enough assets are found, it aborts with an error.

    Build Command Arguments
    It constructs the --names argument for the wallet CLI from the selected notes, and the --recipients argument from the recipient’s pubkey.

    Create Draft Transaction
    Using nockchain-wallet spend, the script creates a draft transaction using the selected notes, recipient, gift, and fee.

    Determine Draft Filename
    The draft transaction file name is based on the last name of the first selected note and stored inside a txs directory.

    Send Transaction
    The script then uses the nockchain-wallet send-tx command to send the drafted transaction to the network.

    Report Success or Failure
    It outputs whether the transaction file was created and whether the transaction was successfully sent.

Summary

This script streamlines the manual steps required to:

    Select sufficient wallet notes for a transaction,

    Create a draft transaction,

    And send it on the blockchain,

all with simple interactive prompts and automated processing.
